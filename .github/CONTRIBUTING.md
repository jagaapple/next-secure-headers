# Contributing Guidelines
## Language
Git branch names and commit messages, and GitHub pull request should be written in English in order to be readable for
developers around the world.


## Git branch flow
We adhere GitHub Flow to develop this project. Anything in the `main` branch is deployable. To work on something new, create
a descriptively named branch off of main, also add a prefix `feature/` to its name.
A branch name should be started with verb and the most terse and lucid possible.

```bash
# Example
feature/implement-xxx
feature/support-xxx-for-xxx
feature/fix-xxx-bugs
```

For more details, see [GitHub Flow â€“ Scott Chacon](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html).


## Git commit messages convention
Follow the following format for Git commit messages.

```bash
# Format
[<COMMIT_TYPE>] <SUMMARY>

- <DESCRIPTION>

### `<COMMIT_TYPE>`
One commit should have only one purpose, so you should add the following commit type to beginning of line 1 of the commit
message.
